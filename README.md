# WK5HW-Gove-Scheduler

## Description

I have recreated a calendar app which allows me to save appointments for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I have used [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time as learned in class. 

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Usage

1. Use a daily planner to create a schedule
2. Open the planner
3. The current day is displayed at top of the calendar

IF you scroll down, you will timeblocks for standard business hours.
WHEN you view timeblocks for that day, it is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

4. Click into a timeblock
5. Enter an event
6. Click save button for timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

7. Refresh the page to see event entered.
